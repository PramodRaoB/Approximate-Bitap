# Approximate-Bitap

Work on producing an efficient implementation of the approximate string matching Bitap algorithm utilizing some of the following techniques:
- Diagonal-wise parallelisation of the DP table
  - Chunk-wise diagonals parallelisation for additional efficiency
- OMP parallelization
- Utilization of bitsets to speed-up computation
